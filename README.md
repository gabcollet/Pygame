# Pygame
I made this little cowboy game that I named "El cazador de cactus" to learn the basic of pygame and python.<br />
The goal is to kill every cactus man in the map.<br />
You can use the shotgun in the map to make it a bit easier but watch out, your ammo is limited!

# How to install :

First get a working python3 :<br />
You can follow this little tutorial to have the latest version (which is currently the 3.10)<br />
[Tutorial to install python](https://tecadmin.net/how-to-install-python-3-10-on-ubuntu-debian-linuxmint/)

Then install dependencies (with or without the --user option if you want it locally) and clone the repo:
```
pip3 install --user pygame pytmx pytweening
```
```
git clone git@github.com:gabcollet/Pygame.git
```

# To launch :

```
cd pygame
```
```
python3 main.py
```

Instructions are on the main screen.

Enjoy!
